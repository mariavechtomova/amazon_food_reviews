# CNN text classification on Amazon reviews

Purpose of this project is to understand how CNN can be applied for different text classification problems:

- basic binary classification problem (review sentiment)
- multiclass classification problem (review category classification)
- hierarchical classification problem (predicting category and subcategory of the review)

## Code

- `1. Get data`. Automatically downloads, transforms the data and saves the result as csv.
- `2. Data preparation`. Prepares the dataset for modelling and saves the result as a pickle.
- `3a. Sentiment base model`. Implement a baseline model (Random Forest with TF-IDF features) to predict the review sentiment based on the review text. 
- `3b. Sentiment CNN`. Implement a CNN to predict the review sentiment based on the review text.
- `4a. Category1 base model`. Implement a baseline model (Random Forest with TF-IDF features) to predict the first level category of the product in the review.
- `4b. Category1 CNN model`. Implement a CNN to predict the first level category of the product in the review.
- `5a. Category2 base model`. Implement a baseline model (Random Forest with TF-IDF features) to predict the second level category of the product in the review.
- `5b. Category2 CNN model simple`. Implement a simple CNN to predict the second level category of the product in the review.
- `5c. Category2 CNN model advanced`. Implement an advanced CNN to predict the second level category of the product in the review.
- `5d. Category2 CNN model advanced with tweak`. Implement an advanced CNN to predict the second level category of the product in the review. Extra hidden layer added
- `6. Make new predictions`. Create new predictions using the saved model

Helper functions can be found in `helpers.py` file.
